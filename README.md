# DogJSProject

Dog Facts Project

Motivation:

I love Dogs! Well while I've never personally owned one, my partner owns three. I wanted to challenge myself in this project as I am very unfamiliar with Javascript and API calls, so all of this is very new to me. I've only had experience with HTML & CSS but Javascript is where the website moves and feels alive.

This Project is very simple in its design and functions. Straightforward and easy to use. I hope in future to incorporate a more complex design with more varied functions and animations.

P.S. This expository has only small commit as I just got all my files from https://github.com/ChristianWebDev/phase-1-javascript-project-mode where I did all my work which I forked. So I just copied it all so I can host on GITHUB.
